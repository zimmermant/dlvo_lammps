write_coeff command :h3

[Syntax:]

write_coeff file :pre

file = name of data file to write out :pre

[Examples:]

write_coeff polymer.coeff :pre

[Description:]

Write a text format file with the currently defined force field
coefficients in a way, that it can be read by LAMMPS with the 
"include"_include.html command. In combination with the nocoeff
option of "write_data"_write_data.html this can be used to move
the Coeffs sections from a data file into a separate file.

NOTE: The write_coeff command is not yet fully implemented in two
respects.  First, some pair styles do not yet write their coefficient
information into the coeff file.  This means you will need to specify
that information in your input script that reads the data file, via
the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command.
