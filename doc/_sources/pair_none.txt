pair_style none command
=======================

Syntax
""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   pair_style none

Examples
""""""""

.. parsed-literal::

   pair_style none

Description
"""""""""""

Using a pair style of none means pair forces are not computed.

With this choice, the force cutoff is 0.0, which means that only atoms
within the neighbor skin distance (see the :doc:`neighbor <neighbor>`
command) are communicated between processors.  You must insure the
skin distance is large enough to acquire atoms needed for computing
bonds, angles, etc.

A pair style of *none* will also prevent pairwise neighbor lists from
being built.  However if the :doc:`neighbor <neighbor>` style is *bin*,
data structures for binning are still allocated.  If the neighbor skin
distance is small, then these data structures can consume a large
amount of memory.  So you should either set the neighbor style to
*nsq* or set the skin distance to a larger value.
