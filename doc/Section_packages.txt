4. Packages :h3

This section gives a quick overview of the add-on packages that extend
LAMMPS functionality.

4.1 "Standard packages"_#pkg_1
4.2 "User packages"_#pkg_2 :all(b)

LAMMPS includes many optional packages, which are groups of files that
enable a specific set of features.  For example, force fields for
molecular systems or granular systems are in packages.  You can see
the list of all packages by typing "make package" from within the src
directory of the LAMMPS distribution.

See "Section_start 3"_Section_start.html#start_3 of the manual for
details on how to include/exclude specific packages as part of the
LAMMPS build process, and for more details about the differences
between standard packages and user packages.

Unless otherwise noted below, every package is independent of all the
others.  I.e. any package can be included or excluded in a LAMMPS
build, independent of all other packages.  However, note that some
packages include commands derived from commands in other packages.  If
the other package is not installed, the derived command from the new
package will also not be installed when you include the new one.
E.g. the pair lj/cut/coul/long/omp command from the USER-OMP package
will not be installed as part of the USER-OMP package if the KSPACE
package is not also installed, since it contains the pair
lj/cut/coul/long command.  If you later install the KSPACE pacakge and
the USER-OMP package is already installed, both the pair
lj/cut/coul/long and lj/cut/coul/long/omp commands will be installed.

The two tables below list currently available packages in LAMMPS, with
a one-line descriptions of each.  The sections below give a few more
details, including instructions for building LAMMPS with the package,
either via the make command or the Make.py tool described in "Section
2.4"_Section_start.html#start_4.

The "Authors" column lists a name(s) if a specific person is
responible for creating and maintaining the package.
More details on
multiple authors are give below.

(1) The FLD package was created by Amit Kumar and Michael Bybee from
Jonathan Higdon's group at UIUC.

(2) The OPT package was created by James Fischer (High Performance
Technologies), David Richie, and Vincent Natoli (Stone Ridge
Technolgy).

(3) The KIM package was created by Valeriu Smirichinski, Ryan Elliott,
and Ellad Tadmor (U Minn).

(4) The KOKKOS package was created primarily by Christian Trott
(Sandia).  It uses the Kokkos library which was developed by Carter
Edwards, Christian, and collaborators at Sandia.

The "Doc page" column links to either a portion of the
"Section_howto"_Section_howto.html of the manual, or an input script
command implemented as part of the package.

The "Example" column is a sub-directory in the examples directory of
the distribution which has an input script that uses the package.
E.g. "peptide" refers to the examples/peptide directory.

The "Library" column lists an external library which must be built
first and which LAMMPS links to when it is built.  If it is listed as
lib/package, then the code for the library is under the lib directory
of the LAMMPS distribution.  See the lib/package/README file for info
on how to build the library.  If it is not listed as lib/package, then
it is a third-party library not included in the LAMMPS distribution.
See the src/package/README or src/package/Makefile.lammps file for
info on where to download the library.  "Section
start"_Section_start.html#start_3_3 of the manual also gives details
on how to build LAMMPS with both kinds of auxiliary libraries.

Except where explained below, all of these packages can be installed,
and LAMMPS re-built, by issuing these commands from the src dir.

make yes-package
make machine
or
Make.py -p package -a machine :pre

To un-install the package and re-build LAMMPS without it:

make no-package
make machine
or
Make.py -p ^package -a machine :pre

"Package" is the name of the package in lower-case letters,

USER-ATC package :h4

This package implements a "fix atc" command which can be used in a
LAMMPS input script.  This fix can be employed to either do concurrent
coupling of MD with FE-based physics surrogates or on-the-fly
post-processing of atomic information to continuum fields.

See the doc page for the fix atc command to get started.  At the
bottom of the doc page are many links to additional documentation
contained in the doc/USER/atc directory.

There are example scripts for using this package in examples/USER/atc.

This package uses an external library in lib/atc which must be
compiled before making LAMMPS.  See the lib/atc/README file and the
LAMMPS manual for information on building LAMMPS with external
libraries.

The primary people who created this package are Reese Jones (rjones at
sandia.gov), Jeremy Templeton (jatempl at sandia.gov) and Jon
Zimmerman (jzimmer at sandia.gov) at Sandia.  Contact them directly if
you have questions.

:line

USER-AWPMD package :h4

This package contains a LAMMPS implementation of the Antisymmetrized
Wave Packet Molecular Dynamics (AWPMD) method.

See the doc page for the pair_style awpmd/cut command to get started.

There are example scripts for using this package in examples/USER/awpmd.

This package uses an external library in lib/awpmd which must be
compiled before making LAMMPS.  See the lib/awpmd/README file and the
LAMMPS manual for information on building LAMMPS with external
libraries.

The person who created this package is Ilya Valuev at the JIHT in
Russia (valuev at physik.hu-berlin.de).  Contact him directly if you
have questions.

:line

USER-CG-CMM package :h4

This package implements 3 commands which can be used in a LAMMPS input
script:

pair_style lj/sdk
pair_style lj/sdk/coul/long
angle_style sdk :ul

These styles allow coarse grained MD simulations with the
parametrization of Shinoda, DeVane, Klein, Mol Sim, 33, 27 (2007)
(SDK), with extensions to simulate ionic liquids, electrolytes, lipids
and charged amino acids.

See the doc pages for these commands for details.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/USER/cg-cmm.

This is the second generation implementation reducing the the clutter
of the previous version. For many systems with electrostatics, it will
be faster to use pair_style hybrid/overlay with lj/sdk and coul/long
instead of the combined lj/sdk/coul/long style.  since the number of
charged atom types is usually small.  For any other coulomb
interactions this is now required.  To exploit this property, the use
of the kspace_style pppm/cg is recommended over regular pppm. For all
new styles, input file backward compatibility is provided.  The old
implementation is still available through appending the /old
suffix. These will be discontinued and removed after the new
implementation has been fully validated.

The current version of this package should be considered beta
quality. The CG potentials work correctly for "normal" situations, but
have not been testing with all kinds of potential parameters and
simulation systems.

The person who created this package is Axel Kohlmeyer at Temple U
(akohlmey at gmail.com).  Contact him directly if you have questions.

:line

USER-COLVARS package :h4

This package implements the "fix colvars" command which can be
used in a LAMMPS input script.

This fix allows to use "collective variables" to implement
Adaptive Biasing Force, Metadynamics, Steered MD, Umbrella
Sampling and Restraints. This code consists of two parts:

A portable collective variable module library written and maintained
by Giacomo Fiorin (ICMS, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and
Jerome Henin (LISM, CNRS, Marseille, France). This code is located in
the directory lib/colvars and needs to be compiled first.  The colvars
fix and an interface layer, exchanges information between LAMMPS and
the collective variable module. :ul

See the doc page of "fix colvars"_fix_colvars.html for more details.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/USER/colvars

This is a very new interface that does not yet support all
features in the module and will see future optimizations
and improvements. The colvars module library is also available
in NAMD has been thoroughly used and tested there. Bugs and
problems are likely due to the interface layers code.
Thus the current version of this package should be considered
beta quality.

The person who created this package is Axel Kohlmeyer at Temple U
(akohlmey at gmail.com).  Contact him directly if you have questions.

:line

USER-CUDA package :h4

USER-EFF package :h4

This package contains a LAMMPS implementation of the electron Force
Field (eFF) currently under development at Caltech, as described in
A. Jaramillo-Botero, J. Su, Q. An, and W.A. Goddard III, JCC,
2010. The eFF potential was first introduced by Su and Goddard, in
2007.

eFF can be viewed as an approximation to QM wave packet dynamics and
Fermionic molecular dynamics, combining the ability of electronic
structure methods to describe atomic structure, bonding, and chemistry
in materials, and of plasma methods to describe nonequilibrium
dynamics of large systems with a large number of highly excited
electrons. We classify it as a mixed QM-classical approach rather than
a conventional force field method, which introduces QM-based terms (a
spin-dependent repulsion term to account for the Pauli exclusion
principle and the electron wavefunction kinetic energy associated with
the Heisenberg principle) that reduce, along with classical
electrostatic terms between nuclei and electrons, to the sum of a set
of effective pairwise potentials.  This makes eFF uniquely suited to
simulate materials over a wide range of temperatures and pressures
where electronically excited and ionized states of matter can occur
and coexist.

The necessary customizations to the LAMMPS core are in place to
enable the correct handling of explicit electron properties during
minimization and dynamics.

See the doc page for the pair_style eff/cut command to get started.

There are example scripts for using this package in
examples/USER/eff.

USER-H5MD package :h4

This package contains a "dump h5md"_dump_h5md.html command for
performing a dump of atom properties in HDF5 format.  "HDF5
files"_HDF5 are binary, portable and self-describing and can be
examined and used by a variety of auxiliary tools.  The output HDF5
files are structured in a format called H5MD, which was designed to
store molecular data, and can be used and produced by various MD and
MD-related codes.  The "dump h5md"_doc/dump_h5md.html command gives a
citation to a paper describing the format.

uwo.ca) and Colin (cdennist at uwo.ca) Denniston, University of
Western Ontario.  Contact them directly if you have questions.

:line

USER-MGPT package :h4

This package contains a fast implementation for LAMMPS of
quantum-based MGPT multi-ion potentials.  The MGPT or model GPT method
derives from first-principles DFT-based generalized pseudopotential
theory (GPT) through a series of systematic approximations valid for
mid-period transition metals with nearly half-filled d bands.  The
MGPT method was originally developed by John Moriarty at Lawrence
Livermore National Lab (LLNL).

In the general matrix representation of MGPT, which can also be
applied to f-band actinide metals, the multi-ion potentials are
evaluated on the fly during a simulation through d- or f-state matrix
multiplication, and the forces that move the ions are determined
analytically.  The {mgpt} pair style in this package calculates forces
and energies using an optimized matrix-MGPT algorithm due to Tomas
Oppelstrup at LLNL.

See this doc page to get started:

"pair_style mgpt"_pair_mgpt.html

The persons who created the USER-MGPT package are Tomas Oppelstrup
(oppelstrup2@llnl.gov) and John Moriarty (moriarty2@llnl.gov)
Contact them directly if you have any questions.

:line

USER-MISC package :h4

The files in this package are a potpourri of (mostly) unrelated
features contributed to LAMMPS by users.  Each feature is a single
pair of files (*.cpp and *.h).

More information about each feature can be found by reading its doc
page in the LAMMPS doc directory.  The doc page which lists all LAMMPS
input script commands is as follows:

"Section_commands"_Section_commands.html#cmd_5

User-contributed features are listed at the bottom of the fix,
compute, pair, etc sections.

The list of features and author of each is given in the
src/USER-MISC/README file.

You should contact the author directly if you have specific questions
about the feature or its coding.

:line

USER-MOLFILE package :h4

This package contains a dump molfile command which uses molfile
plugins that are bundled with the
"VMD"_http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd molecular visualization and
analysis program, to enable LAMMPS to dump its information in formats
compatible with various molecular simulation tools.

The package only provides the interface code, not the plugins.  These
can be obtained from a VMD installation which has to match the
platform that you are using to compile LAMMPS for. By adding plugins
to VMD, support for new file formats can be added to LAMMPS (or VMD or
other programs that use them) without having to recompile the
application itself.

See this doc page to get started:

USER-PHONON package :h4

This package contains a fix phonon command that calculates dynamical
matrices, which can then be used to compute phonon dispersion
relations, directly from molecular dynamics simulations.

See this doc page to get started:

"fix phonon"_fix_phonon.html

USER-QMMM package :h4

This package provides a fix qmmm command which allows LAMMPS to be
used in a QM/MM simulation, currently only in combination with pw.x
code from the "Quantum ESPRESSO"_espresso package.

:link(espresso,http://www.quantum-espresso.org)

The current implementation only supports an ONIOM style mechanical
coupling to the Quantum ESPRESSO plane wave DFT package.
Electrostatic coupling is in preparation and the interface has been
written in a manner that coupling to other QM codes should be possible
without changes to LAMMPS itself.

See this doc page to get started:

"fix qmmm"_fix_qmmm.html

as well as the lib/qmmm/README file.

USER-QTB package :h4

This package provides a self-consistent quantum treatment of the
vibrational modes in a classical molecular dynamics simulation.  By
coupling the MD simulation to a colored thermostat, it introduces zero
point energy into the system, alter the energy power spectrum and the
heat capacity towards their quantum nature. This package could be of
interest if one wants to model systems at temperatures lower than
their classical limits or when temperatures ramp up across the
classical limits in the simulation.

See these two doc pages to get started:

"fix qtb"_fix_qtb.html provides quantum nulcear correction through a
colored thermostat and can be used with other time integration schemes
like "fix nve"_fix_nve.html or "fix nph"_fix_nh.html.

"fix qbmsst"_fix_qbmsst.html enables quantum nuclear correction of a
multi-scale shock technique simulation by coupling the quantum thermal
bath with the shocked system.

USER-REAXC package :h4

This package contains a implementation for LAMMPS of the ReaxFF force
field.  ReaxFF uses distance-dependent bond-order functions to
represent the contributions of chemical bonding to the potential
energy.  It was originally developed by Adri van Duin and the Goddard
group at CalTech.

The USER-REAXC version of ReaxFF (pair_style reax/c), implemented in
C, should give identical or very similar results to pair_style reax,
which is a ReaxFF implementation on top of a Fortran library, a
version of which library was originally authored by Adri van Duin.

The reax/c version should be somewhat faster and more scalable,
particularly with respect to the charge equilibration calculation.  It
should also be easier to build and use since there are no complicating
issues with Fortran memory allocation or linking to a Fortran library.

For technical details about this implemention of ReaxFF, see
this paper:

Parallel and Scalable Reactive Molecular Dynamics: Numerical Methods
and Algorithmic Techniques, H. M. Aktulga, J. C. Fogarty,
S. A. Pandit, A. Y. Grama, Parallel Computing, in press (2011).

See the doc page for the pair_style reax/c command for details
of how to use it in LAMMPS.

USER-SMD package :h4

This package implements smoothed Mach dynamics (SMD) in
LAMMPS.  Currently, the package has the following features:

* Does liquids via traditional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)

* Also solves solids mechanics problems via a state of the art 
  stabilized meshless method with hourglass control.

* Can specify hydrostatic interactions independently from material 
  strength models, i.e. pressure and deviatoric stresses are separated.

* Many material models available (Johnson-Cook, plasticity with 
  hardening, Mie-Grueneisen, Polynomial EOS).  Easy to add new 
  material models.

* Rigid boundary conditions (walls) can be loaded as surface geometries 
  from *.STL files.

See the file doc/PDF/SMD_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to get started.

There are example scripts for using this package in examples/USER/smd.

USER-SPH package :h4

This package implements smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in
LAMMPS.  Currently, the package has the following features:

* Tait, ideal gas, Lennard-Jones equation of states, full support for 
  complete (i.e. internal-energy dependent) equations of state

* Plain or Monaghans XSPH integration of the equations of motion

* Density continuity or density summation to propagate the density field

* Commands to set internal energy and density of particles from the 
  input script

* Output commands to access internal energy and density for dumping and 
  thermo output

See the file doc/PDF/SPH_LAMMPS_userguide.pdf to get started.

There are example scripts for using this package in examples/USER/sph.
